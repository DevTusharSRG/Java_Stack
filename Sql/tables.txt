 Key Notes
âœ” Foreign keys ensure referential integrity.  
âœ” One-to-Many relationships define dependencies (e.g., One Farmer â†’ Many Properties).  
âœ” Many-to-One relations prevent duplicate data while allowing scalability.  
âœ” Independent tables (contact, governmentSchemes) are managed separately.

This design ensures efficient data handling for your collaborative farming system. ðŸš€
